for the easy bot 
    when the bot starts the game : bot returns first element in spells
    otherwise 
        bot takes last letter from previous spell
        bot will look at the spells that start with that letter
        when bot encounters a spell that starts with that letter and hasnt been casted yet it will return it

for the medium bot
    when bot starts the game : bot returns first element in spells
    otherwise 
        bot takes last letter from previous spell
        bot will find all the spells that start with this letter and havent been casted and places them in an array
        bot will go over each spell in said array and will take the last letter 
        bot will now count how many spells start with said letter and place them in an array
        bot will now find the minimum meaning the spell that will yield the minimum number of options for the oponent 
        bot returns the spell found at the location of minimum 

for the hard bot : minimax implementation 
    when bot starts the game, bot will go over all the spells to find the spell that will end the game (the last letter of the spell will not be a starting letter to any spell)
    if bot doesnt find said spell bot returns the first spell in the list
    otherwise 
        bot runs the minimax algorithm 
        minimax will determine the best move for the bot 
        bot can return: the spell that will make bot win or it searches for the best move 
        the best move is a move that leads to the fewest number of winning moves for the oponent
